# ClinDBS-Viewer - Interactive EEG & DBS Signal Processing Tool


## Overview  
ClinDBS Viewer is an interactive tool for processing and analyzing EEG and DBS signals.  
Designed for researchers and engineers working on neurological data, this application provides an intuitive interface for event marking, data visualization, and real-time signal analysis.

This project integrates **signal processing techniques**, **machine learning workflows**, and **interactive GUI elements** to assist in understanding neurological patterns.  
It enables efficient preprocessing of EEG and DBS signals, making it easier to extract meaningful insights and develop **data-driven models**.



## Features  

### 1️⃣ Load EEG File  
Load EEG recordings into the application for interactive analysis. This feature allows users to import EEG signals from standard formats and visualize them in real-time.

### 4️⃣ Synchronization Cutting  
This feature aligns the EEG and DBS signals based on values computed by a **Transformer model**. The model determines the optimal alignment parameters to ensure the signals are synchronized correctly before further processing.
